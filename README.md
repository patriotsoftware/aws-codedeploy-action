# AWS CodeDeploy Action
_To automatically deploy applications to EC2 via CodeDeploy. [Looking for ECS?](https://github.com/sourcetoad/aws-ecs-deploy-action)_

---

## Usage

The best example is just a snippet of the workflow with all options.

Laravel (All Properties) Example

```yaml
- name: AWS CodeDeploy
  uses: sourcetoad/aws-codedeploy-action@v1
  with:
    aws_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws_secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
    aws_region: us-east-1
    codedeploy_name: project
    codedeploy_group: prod
    codedeploy_register_only: true
    s3_bucket: project-codedeploy
    s3_folder: production
    excluded_files: '.git/* .env storage/framework/cache/* node_modules/*'
    max_polling_iterations: 60
    directory: ./
```

Laravel (Only Required) Example

* This leverages the official [GitHub Action for AWS Credentials](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions)

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role
    aws-region: us-east-2

- name: AWS CodeDeploy
  uses: sourcetoad/aws-codedeploy-action@v1
  with:
    codedeploy_name: project
    codedeploy_group: prod
    s3_bucket: project-codedeploy
    s3_folder: production
```

* Remember to set specific permissions so we can communicate with the GitHub OIDC Endpoint.

```yaml
permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read
```

### outputs

Following outputs can be used after execution of the job.

| Name            | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `zip_filename`  | Filename of generated zip file.                  |  
| `etag`          | ETag for the generated zip file reported by AWS. |
| `deployment_id` | The CodeDeploy deployment id                     |

## Skip waiting during deployment
Some projects may not want to poll for a completion of a build. Setting `max_polling_iterations` to `0` will exit
the script after the deployment was kicked off. Progress will have to be monitored elsewhere.

## Archive or Build
Some projects may have a complex build system or even build the archive in a previous step. This is where
`directory` and `archive` come into play:

 * By default, `directory` will be used to zip that directory and deployed.
 * If `archive` is non-empty, it will be used in place of `directory`
 * `archive` must be zip filename including extension (ie `prod-backend-20220202.zip`).

## IAM Permissions

You shouldn't be using a root user. Below are snippets of an inline policies with suggested permissions for the action. 

 * You might need to adapt these to fit your use case.
 * You will need to insert proper resources/ARNs to make the snippets below valid.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::project-codedeploy/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

 * This restricts the action to uploading an object and listing/getting the object so it can obtain the location for CodeDeploy
 * It is restricted to a specific bucket.

For deploying via CodeDeploy you will need another set of permissions.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "codedeploy:CreateDeployment"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:codedeploy:codedeploy-arn"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "codedeploy:Batch*",
                "codedeploy:Get*",
                "codedeploy:List*",
                "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

 * These permissions are a rough example of allowing the user to list/get/register a revision for all resources
 * A specific permission statement exists to lock creating the deployment to a specific resource
